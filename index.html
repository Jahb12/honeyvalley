    <div class="container-w">
        <div class="firstcolumn">
            <h3 style="color: black;"> <b> Rich in Antioxidants </b></h3>
            <p style="color: #444444;" class="parafont">Many  of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a<br>natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But<br>specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised<br>throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties. </p>
    
            <h3 style="color: black;"> <b>Improves Cholesterol</b></h3>
            <p style="color: #444444;" class="parafont">
                Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol<br>
                by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey may<br>
                also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="secondcolumn">
            <h3 style="color: black;"> <b>Natural Cough Medicine </b></h3>
            <p style="color: #444444;" class="parafont">Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study<br>
                , it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that<br>
                contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create<br>
                your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with<br>
                herbal tea or warm water and lemon </p>
    
            <h3 style="color: black;"> <b>Improves Heart Health</b></h3>
            <p style="color: #444444;" class="parafont"> It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may<br>
                support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants<br>
                could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk<br>
                for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm<br>
                those findings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thirdcolumn">
            <h3 style="color: black;"> <b>Lowers Blood Pressure</b></h3>
            <p style="color: #444444;" class="parafont">Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey<br>
                may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that<br>
                have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans<br>
                have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey. </p>
    
            <h3 style="color: black;"> <b>Antibacterial properties</b></h3>
            <p style="color: #444444;" class="parafont">Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its<br>
                antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help<br>
                stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level.<br>
                This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get<br>
                dehydrated and die off.</p>

            <p class="fontp" style="color: #444444;">I have been trying to embrace a more holistic life style and
                focusing on having a more natural, low processing and
                preservative diet. I have opted to reduce my sugar intake and
                change out to honey. I feel more assure that MTA honey valley is
                of the purest form as I have seen the GMPs employed by this
                company and have confidence in their ethical practices. I also
                used honey in my skin care routine and have been seeing big

                    health being number 1. And over the years I have tried numerous
                    brand of honey and I was always satisfied with the quality of them,
                    until I tried MTA Honey Valley. The quality of Honey Valley's
                    honey is second to none. Ever since I tried the first bottle I have
                    not used another brand since and I have absolutely no intention
                    of using any. The product quality is exceptional and the customer
                    service from the MTA Honey valley team is top notch. MTA
